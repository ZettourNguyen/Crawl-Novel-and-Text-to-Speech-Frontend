# Crawl Novel & Text-to-Speech (TTS)

This project is designed to provide two key functionalities: web scraping of novel content and text-to-speech (TTS) conversion. Users can either crawl novel chapters from websites and convert them to audio or use the text-to-speech feature directly. The project supports multiple TTS services, including AWS and Azure, offering a wide variety of voices in both English and Vietnamese.
